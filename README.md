# Motivation

I want to know why Nashville doesn't have adequate public transportation.  
If you live in Nashville or in the surrounding area, you cannot survive without a car.
People should not have to own a vehicle to live.  
My analysis will show the different ways that the Nashville public transoportation is inadequate and what can be done to improve it.

I will be comparing the public transportation systems of four cities, Nashville, Denver, San Francisco, and New York City.  
I have visisted these cities and used their public transportation as the only means of transportation.  
During this time I was able to visit all of the tourist sites, travel within the city efficiently, and visit neighboring towns.
Density per square mile, population served, revenue miles, and total trips are the metrics that will be used to measure performance.
These metrics will ensure that the four cities are compared on an even scale regardless of money spent, land mass, or population served.


# Questions

1. Does Nashville provide efficient, effective, ande comprehensive public transportation?
2. How do the other cities compare to Nashville?
3. What is the first thing that Nashville could do to improve it's public transportation services?

# Normalizing the Data

Data from the federal transit administration listed 6,229 seperated agencies across the continental United States and its territories.
To normalize the data I selected four agencies that I've personally used and compared the cities' performance using density per square mile.
I created data frames in pandas to show only the agencies and metrics that are being used to compare performances.
SQL was used to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

# Hurdles and Challenges

It was a challenge to find a way to compare the four cities in a way that was meaningful.  
Each city is unique in its own way and the public transportation provided reflects that.
Making comparisons between them only showed that they were different.
Using metrics such as density, revenue miles, and total trips allowed for measurements in efficiency and effectiveness.
These statistics were then measured to statistical averages of the entire data set of 6,229 cities.
